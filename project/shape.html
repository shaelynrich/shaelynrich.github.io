      <h2>Shape</h2>
      <p>A shape is an enclosed object that is 2-dimensional (usually created through use of lines).</p>

      <p>There are two types of shapes: Geometric and Organic. Look at an every day object and try picking out the basic shapes within it. I guarantee that each object is made from shapes. Look at the form and how each shape interacts with one another. Using this technique can greatly improve drawing and designing skills. A composition doesn't have to be complicated to be good.</p>
