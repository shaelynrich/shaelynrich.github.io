      <h2>Planning Document</h2>
      <h3>Target Audience</h3>
      <p>The target audience of this site mainly includes young art enthusiasts seeking help and ideas for their compositions. The age range of this group is roughly 13-20 years old. These are mostly students attending middle school or high school. They don’t have much of an income and they are the child of a family. This audience enjoys doing art and thinks of it as one of their favorite hobbies. This site is targeted towards beginners that are just learning about art. The site is simple because the audience won’t have much experience on this topic. Often times, the target audience will have been introduced to the arts through a class in school.
        <br> When the audience accesses this site they will most likely be sitting at home using a laptop. They might access it for some ideas and help for homework and using a laptop is the easiest way for researching things like that. The location of the visitor will not impact the content delivery as the site is designed for English speakers around the world. The site will be accessed in the afternoon or evening hours of the day.
