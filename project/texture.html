      <p>There are two main types of texture: Mechanical and Organic. As I'm sure you can guess, mechanical textures are man-made. For example, the texture of a car tire, fridge door, leather couch, etc. Organic textures can be found in nature. For example, an organic texture could be the trunk of a tree, grains of a seashell, skin of an avocado, etc. Sometimes the most detailed and textured compositions are not always the best. There is a time and place for everything. In fact, there are even modern day logos that appear to have absolutely no texture. The texture is so smooth that they look flat. Does that mean they are bad designs? Not necessarily. When designing, make sure to keep the texture of objects in mind as it can have a large affect on how successful the outcome is.</p>
