      <p>What is the first type of line that comes to mind? It's probably straight. It doesn't matter whether it is horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. It is still just a typical, ordinary, boring line. Lines control the viewer's eye. Don't just draw lines to draw a line. Always make sure that each part of the composition, no matter how minuscule it may seem, has a purpose.</p>
