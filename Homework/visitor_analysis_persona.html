        <h2>Visitor Analysis</h2>

        <p>What are their demographics?
          <br> In my opinion McDonalds’ target audience is very large. It can appeal to a lot of different people. However, I would say that most people would be between the ages of the high school years up until the late 20’s or mid 30’s. These are generally people that might not have a lot of time, aren’t extremely worried about healthiness, and just want something fast and easy. They expect to buy cheap food and so they do not necessarily have a high income. Their education is high school lever, college students tend to go here often. McDonalds is located all over the world and you can usually find them at off ramps from the freeway and other towns.
        </p>
        <p>
          How did the site meet the needs of the visitor?
          <br> I think that most people that go to the McDonalds website will be using a phone and this mobile browser works great for that, as you can see by the screenshots. Their main concern is going to be about the menu and location. As far as “less is more” goes, the site was filled with large pictures. There was not a lot of white space, however I was not overwhelmed with it compared to other sites that constantly had advertisements popping up. There were only a few buttons on the navigation bar which made it easy and simple to read. This fits the visitor’s needs as they are not looking for paragraphs of explanation, they actually want to see the pictures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Describe how the content was organized to facilitate it being found.
          <br> There were banners of images all the way down the home screen which featured deals within the application, nutrition facts, and how to subscribe for emails. I would not say that part was too important because I think most people have a purpose in mind when they search on McDonald’s website. There is a logo in the middle of the navigation bar which, when clicked, brings the user back home. The locate button included a search bar to input a zip code or even had the ability to locate the nearest location from your phone. The drop down menu had a lot of topics and then subtopics to more easily find what you are looking for.
        </p>
        <p>
          What did the site do to make the mobile experience enjoyable? <br>
          I think the best part about this site is that it is very easy to use. The buttons, and where to click is made very obvious. The design, colors, and pictures keep my interest. The site is not boring to look at. It even has a search bar to use if you do not want to use any of the topics of subtopics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Did the site seem to facilitate people in a mobile environment? <br>
          I think this site was definitely created with a mobile environment in mind. People that go to McDonalds are usually on the go and not home/do not have access to a computer and it seems like McDonalds understands that if there is no computer, there is always a phone…and a phone is never left home.

        <h3>Site Contrast</h3>

        <p>
          Did they or did they not know who their target audience was? <br>
          I think they knew that their main target audience would be women. This is shown through their use of images. On their banner all they have are dresses and other things that only women would be interested in. <br>
          Did they or did they not meet the needs of their audience? <br>
          I think they did an average job of meeting the need of knowing where the location of stores are. Once you type the zip code there is a list of closest stores that come up. The problem I had was that the search bar says to only type in a zip code or an address. I do not always know the zip code of where I currently am (if I am travelling or something like that) but I tried typing a city and found out that also works. I was not impressed with the inventory displayed. Another need of the audience is to know what they sell. I understand that their inventory changes all the time and that each store is different, but I do expect to know what kind of clothes they sell. For example, I would have to go to departments>women>ladies and then scroll until I find shoes. There is no search bar for this. <br>
          Did they or did they not organize content to facilitate it being found? <br>
          They did have a navigation bar with the logo, store locator, and drop down menu at the top. However, you had to click on the buttons to hide or show something. This is not a huge deal but on other sites I am used to being able to swipe left or right. Their biggest downfall is not having a search bar. If I want to know if they carry jackets I could just search it instead of having to click on the ladies department and then scroll down to guess whether they have a picture of a jacket or not. <br>
          Did the site facilitate visitors in a mobile environment? <br>
          I suppose the site did facilitate visitors in a mobile environment but it was not very enjoyable. After visiting that site I probably would not go out of my way to go there. Having been to Ross before, I think you would have to go inside the store to actually get a feel for what that company is.
