          <h2>Audience</h2>

                    <p>
            The target audience for this website includes people aged 25-45. These are people that usually have a clear schedule and may need to plan according to the weather will be like. People younger than this would not take the time to check the temperature and might participate in activities regardless of how hot or cold the day is. People older than this tend to look outside and do not want to rely on a website. <br>
                      The audience will have a high school or college education with an average income. Most of them will be married with children. <br>
                      These people obviously experience the weather everyday, however they are not experts or meterologists. They are just looking for a breif, yet accurate description so that they can know what to expect. <br>
                      They are most likely going to access this site on their mobile devices before they leave/on their way for work in the morning. <br>
                      This means that when they visit the site they want to see the information straight away without having to navigate through different pages.
